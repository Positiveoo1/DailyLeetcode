# Leetcode 100 Solutions

![Project Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Progress-0%2F100-brightgreen.svg)

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to **100 Leetcode problems**, which I am solving daily to improve my problem-solving and coding skills. Each solution includes code, and my thought process for solving the problems.

I started this project to consistently practice algorithms and data structures while tracking my progress publicly. I aim to complete 100 problems in a set timeframe.

## Structure

- Each file represents a **Leetcode problem** with the following contents:
  - **Solution file(s)**: My solution in the language of choice JavaScript
  - **Explanation.md**: A detailed explanation of my approach and the logic behind the solution.
  - **Test Cases**: Some sample inputs and outputs that demonstrate how the solution works.


## How It Works

- **Daily Commit**: I solve one problem per day and push the solution to this repository.
- **Languages**: Primarily using Python (feel free to adapt this to whatever language you're using).
- **Approaches**: Different types of algorithms, data structures, and optimizations will be covered.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Positiveoo1/DailyLeetcode
   ```

2. Navigate to the problem folder:
   ```bash
   cd Leetcode-100-Solutions/Leetcode5
   ```
